    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **About Inputs**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: What kind of input does the function expect?**  \n",
    "A: The function expects a dictionary where:  \n",
    "- Keys are student names (strings).  \n",
    "- Values are lists of **7 numerical grades** (percentages between 0 and 100).  \n",
    "For example:  \n",
    "```python\n",
    "{\n",
    "    \"Alice\": [95, 90, 85, 80, 75, 70, 65],\n",
    "    \"Bob\": [88, 92, 78, 85, 90, 88, 95]\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Will there be any invalid inputs?**  \n",
    "**A:** No, the inputs are guaranteed to be valid.  \n",
    "- All students will have exactly **7 grades**.  \n",
    "- Grades will always be numerical values (no strings or special characters).  \n",
    "- Grades will always fall within the valid range (0-100).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: How many students can the input include?**  \n",
    "**A:** The number of students may vary depending on the test. The function is designed to handle any number of students, from a single student to an entire class.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **About the Functionality**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: How does the function calculate individual GPA?**  \n",
    "**A:** The function uses the **Individual GPA Calculator** from Task 1. Each student’s percentage grades are converted to GPA points using the predefined grading scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: How does the function calculate the class average GPA?**  \n",
    "**A:** The function computes the average of all individual GPAs by summing them up and dividing by the total number of students.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: What happens if there’s only one student?**  \n",
    "**A:** If there’s only one student, the class average GPA will simply be that student’s GPA.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**  \n",
    "```python\n",
    "{\n",
    "    \"Alice\": [95, 90, 85, 80, 75, 70, 65]\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Output:**  \n",
    "`3.36`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Will the function always return a number?**  \n",
    "**A:** Yes, the function will always return a valid GPA value since the input is guaranteed to be correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Is the GPA always rounded?**  \n",
    "**A:** Yes, the final class average GPA is rounded to **2 decimal places** for consistency.\n"

    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "### **About Password Requirements**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: What are the requirements for a valid password?**  \n",
    "**A:** A password is valid if it meets the following criteria:  \n",
    "1. It is at least **8 characters long**.  \n",
    "2. It contains at least **one uppercase letter**.  \n",
